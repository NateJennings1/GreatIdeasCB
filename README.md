Representation and Prediction of Colorectal Cancer Using Gut Microbiome Data
As we learned in class, bacteria is almost ten times more abundant in our bodies than even our normal cells, which only highlights the numerous relationships that could exist between our cells and the bacteria living in our bodies. In fact, it is because of bacteria’s interactions with the food we eat and our body processes that we get many viral infections, spontaneous diseases, and even contribute to problems like obesity and heart disease. Therefore, our group’s proposed project is to study the gut microbiome, transform the large amount of data into a more usable representation, and use that representation to predict the disease of colorectal cancer associated with the communities of bacteria in the gut. We aim to analyze gut microbiome data to find the differences in the presence of groups of bacteria in colorectal cancer. We plan to use data from the Human Microbiome Project, which provides us access to information regarding all the different communities of bacteria and their relationship with diseases. We also plan to use datasets provided for colorectal cancer in the following linked paper. The computational complexity in this project will come from designing and implementing autoencoders in our algorithm to condense the gut microbiome data into a usable representation, which will be done using a neural network and guidance from this paper. Using this autoencoder, we can then create our latent representation of the gut microbiome data, which we would use to train and test our disease prediction model. Our idea for now is to implement a shallow autoencoder first, and then expand our algorithm to perhaps include more hidden/internal layers and a greater number of nodes in each layer. We believe that this is the most feasible use of data and algorithms, as prediction models need a dataset with smaller dimensions to be the most efficient. Furthermore, the autoencoder approach will be a great way to incorporate our network knowledge to an applicable dataset.
